"""
Deterministic Synthetic Seed Data Generator for PRECURSOR-X.

DATA PROVENANCE: everything produced by this module is SYNTHETIC DEMONSTRATION DATA,
generated with a fixed random seed for reproducibility across deploys. It exists solely
to give the time-series-driven charts (Dashboard telemetry, Safety DNA occurrence counts,
Risk Intelligence 5x5 matrix, What Changed differential) enough volume to render
meaningfully. Nothing here is inserted anywhere except PostgreSQL via app/db/seed.py, and
every row is written with the same SYNTHETIC/DEMO provenance as the rest of the seed data.
No value from this module is ever hardcoded into the frontend — it only ever reaches the
UI by being read back out of the database through the normal API routes.

Regenerating with the same SEED always produces the same rows, so re-running the seed
script is reproducible and idempotent-looking (though the actual insert loops in
app/db/seed.py are separately guarded to only run once per table).
